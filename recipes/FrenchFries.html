    <h2>What is French Fries</h2>
    <p>
        French fries (or simply fries, also known as chips among other names) are batonnet or julienne-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven, such as an air fryer.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
            <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
